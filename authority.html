									<h3>Authority</h3>
									<p>
										Another theme of the course is authority, which is another social mechanism that exists inside and outside educational institutions. Schools teach students what authority is and how people submit to authority. First, there is a power structure within school's that comes with authority. There is the principal of the school at the top, then the teachers, and then the students at the bottom. The people with power include the teachers and the principal. They hold this power by controlling students' grades, writing reports, moving them to another school, and suspending and expelling students from coming to school. Because the teachers hold such power, students obey what teachers say and thus are under the authority of the teachers. Students experience such authority throughout their schooling life, with over a decade under specific authority. Therefore they learn to live under an authoritarian rule.
									</p>
									<p>
										As a result of learning and living under authority, students are used to the concept of panopticism. Panopticism is a concept where one would behave thinking that they are under scrutiny and being watched. Thus students behave differently. Due to this, students cannot be their actual selves. Instead, they follow the rules that the people with power set out. These students do not get in trouble, such as getting a record on their file, or being suspended or expelled. Authority here translates to adult life where students are now adults and live a life where they obey authority and strictly follow the rules set out by what society deems is correct. People that stray away from these rules are marked as outcasts and are treated differently than the rest because they do not follow the authoritarian rule. 									</p>
									<p>
										Additionally, relating to panopticism and how one may be watched and scrutinized at all times by cameras and others, people behave differently when they are out in public as opposed to when they are at home. Society now shows people two ways, what they are like outside in public, and how they behave at home when they are not under a watchful eye. Thus, the authority that students learn in school affects the society around us.
