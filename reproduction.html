									<h3>Reproduction</h3>
									<p>
										Reproduction is one of the four social mechanisms inside and outside educational institutions. Things learned from school translate outside of school and into the real world of adulthood; this is the definition of reproduction. To be more precise, schools produce norms that exist in the world, and this can be negative. For example, a young boy enjoys playing with all sorts of toys at home before he begins going to school. These toys range from a doll to lego to cooking sets to cars. However, once a young boy begins going into kindergarten, something changes. The boy starts to play only with his toy cars and lego set. He does not play with his doll and cooking set anymore. The reason? Because of seeing how his peers play with one collection of toys, particularly the toys associated with cars and legos.
									</p>
									<p>
										Additionally, all the toys are sorted into a section for boys and a section for girls, further segregating these groups. As a result, this introduces gender norms to kids in school at a very young age. These gender norms affect the kids as they grow older, associating activities to be gender-specific and perpetuating a cycle of segregation. Therefore, we can easily see that reproduction comes into play, as illustrated by this example of how schools reproduce easily identifiable norms. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Now that the social mechanism of reproduction is defined, we can see it applied in various aspects. One of these concepts is factory schooling, closely related to reproduction. Factory schooling relates to how everyone that goes into the school is the same and that the institutions are teaching people to be compliant. They are leading people to become compliant because they will soon become obedient factory workers under a manager to which these workers will listen and obey commands to. Consequently, this reproduction of obedient workers brings us back to the social mechanism of reproduction, but in this sense, it is not a good thing. Schools were created to match what it is like in a factory, with time segments such as different periods during school hours; these coincide with shifts in a factory. As well, schools were used to train people to work in factories in the 1900s; however, the world has changed, and students no longer work in a factory after graduation. This factory schooling forces everyone to learn the same way, at a set pace and assuming everyone is the same hinders the education system. Therefore, being aware of factory schooling is essential to break the cycle for future generations of teachers.
