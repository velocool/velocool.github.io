									<h3>Resistance</h3>
									<p>
										Resistance is one of the four social mechanisms that exist inside and outside educational institutions. Resistance defined in the context of the social mechanisms would mean students' agency to say no to the schooling practices. One may wonder, why would a student want to resist the practices learned in school? There are many reasons; these include culture, language, and beliefs, to name a few. These reasons can create resistance in the students, refusing the practices of the school, and thus students would go out of their way to "not-learn", a concept that will be highlighted.									</p>
									<p>
										One can look at Paulo Freire's: Pedagogy of the Oppressed for a clear example of why one would resist. To illustrate, Akmir from Friere's text is a boy of colour, and he went to a racist school system. One day, an instructor brought up points about slavery in America, and Akmir counted on bringing up valid facts about slavery being an American value. The teacher was astonished and said to Akmir that he does not know the actual value of what it is like to be an American. Because Akmir refuted the teacher, he was moved to a school for kids with problems. Simply resisting the status quo and speaking against the teacher showed resistance, and the teacher moved Akmir just because they could not deal with him. There was a reason why there was resistance from Akmir's side. He had a belief that slavery was an American value. The teacher should have been respectful and found the root cause of the issue before moving Akmir to another school. There needed to be open dialogue from the teachers to handle this correctly, as Akmir demonstrated, "not-learn". Therefore, as a result, because there is no work towards understanding the solution, there is resistance from the student. 									</p>
